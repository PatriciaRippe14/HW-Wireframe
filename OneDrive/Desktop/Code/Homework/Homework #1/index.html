      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Patricia Rippe">

      <p>My life started in Plantation,FL in 1989. Pretty sure the sand and salt from the beaches are still in my veins. I also spent much of my childhood in Georgetown, MA. Playing lots of sports and also loving books made for a grounded/interesting upbringing. I was also obesssed with music. That hasn't stopped in adulthood. </p>

      <p>Now, I spend much of my time helping manage The Denver Tea Room and Coffee Salon, freelance writing, playing with my son, and going to shows when I can. Life is pretty great and I am excited to see where coding brings me.</p>
